#Cholera casedata per Haitian department, starting on October 1st.

Downloaded from the [PAHO website](http://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/ed_haiticoleracases.asp). Automatic download is not possible, has to be done manually. Some departments are missing. On the website there is also some finer grained information available, but not from all communes.
